# zauberon ('sŏw-bă-ŏn)    
A C++ program to simulate the quantum physical characteristics of fundamental particles as 
described in the book 'New Age Quantum Physics' by Al Schneider, ISBN-10: 1467938009.

In the book, fundamental particles are called photons.  For this simulation I've chosen the name 'Zauberon' to eliminate 
confusion with the established concept of a photon, and to pay homage to Al's prowess in the world of magicians.

## Model Concepts
This model of the universe postulates that it is composed **ONLY** of Zauberons that move within space in a single 
program manner, but with varying program parameters. Additionally, the program specifies a state called "collision", and 
specifies what happens to a set of Zauberons associated with a specific collision.

### Spacial Concepts
Space is quantized.  Zauberons can only be positioned at nodes within space's three-dimensional "grid".

## Movement Concepts
The Zauberon movement program description follows:
1. They travel in circular helical paths along a direction vector with either **right** or **left** rotation.
2. The speed of the projection on to their direction vector is constant, and equal to the speed of light.
3. Their mass is inversely proportional to their circular helical radius.
 
## Counter Concepts
Each Zauberon contains a counter that is decremented by one for each wavelength traveled, and incremented for each 
collision. 
 
## Collision Concepts
Zauberons are said to have collided whenever more than one are positioned at the same spacial node.  The following
describe the result of a collision:
1. If only two Zauberons collide:
  * The one with the highest counter reverses direction.
  * If they both have the same rotation the lower one's direction also reverses.
  * Both counters increment by one.
2. If more than two collide:
  * Create two groups, left and right rotation, and sum their counters.
  * Reverse the direction of the Zauberons in the group with the higher sum.
  * If the group sums are equal all directions reverse.
  * If there's only one group their directions reverse.
  * All counters increment by one.

## Plot Of Sample Data
Executing the following command:
```bash
./zauberon -i 1000 -z 100
```
results in a file named **zauberons.dat**.  When plotted with **gnuplot** using the following commands:
```bash
gnuplot
set yrange [25000:75000]
set ticslevel 0 
set xrange [25000:75000]
splot "zauberons.dat" u 1:2:3 with dots
```
the resulting plot looks like this:

Note that the plot will change each time the **zauberon** command is executed because it is generating random data
to define the path characteristics of the various zauberons it creates.
